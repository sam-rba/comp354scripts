Description: Utilities are provided which are of use in the
    packages I have developed for dealing with
    distributions. Currently these packages are GeneralizedHyperbolic,
    VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic and NormalLaplace. Each of these
    packages requires DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample
    skewness and kurtosis, log-histogram, tail plots, moments by
    integration, changing the point about which a moment is
    calculated, functions for testing distributions using inversion
    tests and the Massart inequality. Also includes an implementation
    of the incomplete Bessel K function.
